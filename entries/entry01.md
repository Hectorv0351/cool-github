# Entry 1

For the website im going to make i've decided to go with console programming which seems to be closer to what I want to do which is game related code and this is because i find video games more enjoyable than anything else and I think it helps people sometimes even after hard days which to me seems nice.

Currently i'm still in defining the problem in my project and I'll maybe start researching more on this topic in a later entry or the next one.

A skill that I gained from this was creativity making me think more about what I could do with my website and with my experience with different websites and how their set up i want to try own unique way with games attached to it and it seems that if I fail to make what I want I can still try to make something similar which maybe in the future I'll be able to learn how I want it to be.

When it comes to the topic of gaming i like to play with friends and family and I sometimes like to show them the benefits of gaming because of how much I enjoy them so I like to encourage people to play games and let them enjoy their own type of games with the mass amount of other games there are online that they could enjoy.
